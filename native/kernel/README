   5. Fix some minor bugs such as sending the correct log page ID down. 

2015/4/2 1.2.0.20-1vmw

   Support 512e in ReadCapacity16.

2015/3/27 1.2.0.19-1vmw

   Fix three bugs in driver.
   
   1. Fix PSOD when executing nvmecli in the case of failure of starting controller.
   When ALLOW_IOS_IN_QUIESCED_STAT is enabled, NvmeCtrlr_Start is called in AttachDevice. 
   The controller should't be added to the global list when NvmeCtrlr_Start fails. 

   2. Fix PSOD when setting different values to sub_queue_size and cpl_queue_size.
   The completion queue size should be initialized with parameter cpl_queue_size.

   3. Fix PSOD when CheckIOFunction fails many times.
   In NvmeCtrlr_Start, we will keep probing the device for 60s until it is ready.
   When there’s some software issue or device FW is not ready, the command will return 
   failure immediately. This make the while cycle fully occupy the CPU, so that kernel 
   heartbeat mechanism couldn’t detect the PCPU heartbeat and trigger PSOD. 
   When CheckIOFunction fails, driver should sleep 1s before issuing next command.

2015/3/25 1.2.0.18-1vmw

   Fix the coredump timeout issue.

   Coredump timeout because when NVME_MUL_COMPL_WORLD is enabled, driver don't completed
   the dump command in function scsiIoCompleteCommand.

2015/3/25 1.2.0.17-1vmw

   Correct layout of ReadCapacity16 parameter layout.

2015/3/16 1.2.0.16-1vmw

   Don't write the doorbell register when controller has been stopped.

2015/3/6 1.2.0.15-1vmw

   Pass FUA bit from PSA SCSI READ/WRITE command (except READ6/WRITE6) to NVMe command.

2015/3/6 1.2.0.14-1vmw

   Enhance the debug ability of driver.

   Redesign the DPRINT Macro and add switches for debug dump utils in nvme_debug.c
   See docs/nvme-debug.txt.

2015/3/3 1.2.0.13-1vmw

   Implement SCSI LOG SENSE command in async manner.

   PSA disables blocking before issuing a SCSI command, therefore sCSI LOG SENSE command
   must be handled in an async manner otherwise a PSOD will be caused. This change set
   is to serve this purpose.

2015/2/6 1.2.0.12-1vmw

   Enhance READ CAPACITY (16) command.

2015/2/6 1.2.0.11-1vmw

   Fix a PSOD introduced by previous implementation of SYNC CACHE command

2015/2/6 1.2.0.10-1vmw

   Merge with Micron 5.0.6. Changes include:
   1. Exception handler model.
   2. Asynchronous Event Notifications.
   3. Performance statistics data collection.
   4. SCSI Compliance changes.

2015/1/27 1.2.0.9-1vmw

   Implement SYNC CACHE SCSI command and FLUSH nvme command including the translation
   between them.

2015/1/20 1.2.0.8-1vmw

   Fix the race codition issue on admin command submission and completion.

   Add lock protection in the assignment of cmdInfo->status in submission path.
   With the lock, we can make sure:
   1. all the successful completed command will be cleaned up in submission path;
   2. other submitted commands will be done in completion path.
   3. Unsubmitted commands will be cleaned up immediately in submission path.


2015/1/13 1.2.0.7-1vmw

   Add SCSI LOG SENSE commands with LOG_SENSE_SUPPORTED_PAGES, LOG_SENSE_TEMPERATURE_PAGE
   and LOG_SENSE_IE_PAGE pages supported. Also add Informational Exceptions page for
   SCSI MODE SENSE command.

   With these commands supported, nvme driver is able to provide S.M.A.R.T information
   through esxcli storage core device smart get -d <device name>

2015/1/5 1.2.0.6-1vmw

   Change the "namespace" member of `struct usr_io` to "namespaceID" in nvme.h

   This is to avoid a naming conflict when including nvme.h in a C++ user space
   tool, as "namespace" is a reserved keyword in C++.

2014/12/29 1.2.0.5-1vmw

   Enhance the debug ability of nvme driver and Remove nvme_ctrlr_mgmt.c in
   native/kernel directory.

   Enhance the debug ability of nvme driver:

      1. Enable NVME_DEBUG as default in development.
      2. Change Macro:
         Nvme_LogError        => EPRINT
         Nvme_LogWarning      => WPRINT
         Nvme_LogInfo         => IPRINT
         Nvme_LogVerb         => VPRINT
      3. For Nvme_LogDebug, use DPRINTx to output corresponding log. See
      nvme_debug.h.

   In additional, remove nvme_ctrlr_mgmt.c existing in native/kernel directory
   by mistake.

2014/12/25 1.2.0.4-1vmw

   Remove unnecessary preemption operations when calling vmkcmd->done.

   Scsi command completion should be done in non-preemption context, and
   disabling preemption should be done by PSA layer. Native driver is not
   allowed to disable preemption.

2014/12/18 1.2.0.3-1vmw

   Add core dump support for NVMe driver.

   Add core dump support for NVMe driver. So user can config NVMe device as
   dump disk/partition. ESXi will write core dump data to disk/partiontion
   once PSOD hitted.

2014/12/23 1.2.0.2-1vmw

   Fix PR 1132695: Reduce stack usage in NVMe driver.

   The NVMe driver fails in stack checking at compile time since
   NvmeScsiCmd_DoUnmap function uses 8312 bytes of stack, 5712 over max of 2600.

   This change uses slab to manage the buffer allocation for unmap command to
   avoid stack overflow.

2014/12/11 1.2.0.1-1vmw

   Integrating Micron 5.0.1 nvme driver and enabling multiple completion worlds
   in NVMe driver.

   Bugs fixed in Micron Async NVMe Driver Release 5.0.1

      CYCTWO-922   Eliminate AVSCC and length check in AdminPassThru
      CYCTWO-948   PSOD while running raw device IO with LBA out of range of the
                   device or namespace.
      CYCTWO-1016  Subsequent namespaces not discovered when first namespace has
                   an invalid format.
      CYCTWO-1067  Workaround for kernel allowing IOs while driver is in
                   Quiesced state.
      CYCTWO-1158  TaskMgmt semaphore not unlocked when DoTaskMgmtAbort returns
                   early.

   Fix PR 1322248: Enable multiple completion worlds in NVMe driver.

   Current NVMe driver hands over command completion request to PSA layer.
   Allow driver to do command completion may potentially improve IO performance.
   The reason is driver can do completion in a more efficient and more parallel
   way. With Thor's fix for PR 1032408, it is possible for driver to implement
   this feature.
   Here is a list of code changes:
   1, Driver creates multiple completion worlds instead of PSA.
   2, Driver puts a new IO completion request to a completion queue in interrupt
   world. The enqueue method is flexiable. A basic idea is round robin to all
   of queues.
   3, Each completion world gets the new IO completion request and calls scsi
   command completion callback (AKA. vmkCmd->done).
   4, Driver provides a module parameter for users to specify the total
   completion worlds number.
   5, The scheduling of these completion worlds are done by kernel scheduler.
   Driver never pins the worlds to dedicated PCPU explicitly.

2014/11/26 1.2.0.0-1vmw

   Code refactoring for NVMe driver.

   Code refactoring for NVMe driver to separate the native driver portion and
   common portion. The native driver portion is native driver API specific and
   the common portion includes the NVMe core and SCSI related stuff.

   Bump the version to 1.2.0.0-1vmw as the first version for vsphere-2016.

2015/1/7 1.0e.0.35-1vmw

   Add support for vendor specific command format of Admin Vendor Specific Commands.

   Currently, vendor specific command format of admin vendor specific commands are
   not supported, which means this kind of vendor specific operations are not allowed.
   This change enables this kind of admin vendor specific commands.

2014/12/17 1.0e.0.34-1vmw

   Fix the race codition issue on admin command submission and completion.

   Add lock protection in the assignment of cmdInfo->status in submission path.  With the lock, we can make sure:
   1. all the successful completed command will be cleaned up in submission path;
   2. other submitted commands will be done in completion path.
   3. Unsubmitted commands will be cleaned up immediately in submission path.

2014/12/12 1.0e.0.33-1vmw

   Fix PR 1368770: it is re-opened by a regression defect introduced by change #3211338

   Some user admin requests may have zero uio->length, which will not allocate
   uioDmaEntry, therefore after submitting it to hardware successfully, the code
   should check uioDmaEntry and only do UnmapUserPages() and free uioDmaEntry in the case
   that uioDmaEntry is not NULL.

2014/12/10 1.0e.0.32-1vmw

   Fix PR 1368770: Double cleanup uioDmaEntry for admin command.

   When submitting an admin command, the structure uioDmaEntry can be unmap and
   freed in both submission path and completion path. However, there is a chance
   that the two paths would do cleanup at the same time when the command timeout,
   and meanwhile the interrupt handler is called. This will cause double cleanup
   uioDmaEntry and hit PSOD.

   This change clears cleanup callback in completion path when the submission path
   is called to cleanup uioDmaEntry, so that the cleanup would only be called once.

2014/10/29 1.0e.0.31-1vmw

2014/10/19 1.0e.0.30-1vmw

   Fix PR 1336768: Initilizing response data of inquiry VPD 83H page.

   Currently some fields of response data are not initilized, like association.
   This will cause non-deterministic behavior in the following stage of PSA.
   This change initializes the whole responese data to zero in function
   NvmeScsiCmd_DoInquiryVpd83.

2014/09/19 1.0e.0.29-1vmw

   Fix PR 1310589: a data corruption observed when using NVMe devices in 3-node
                   (or more) vSAN cluster

   When using NVMe devices under multi-node vSAN, the IO stack may issue large
   amount of unaligned IOs down to the driver, and some of the unaligned IOs
   cannot be properly handled by NVMe controller if the lower two bits of the
   first scatter-gather element address are not zero. This is because the NVMe
   spec defines that the last two bits of a PRP entry are reserved and must be
   zero.

   On Intel NVMe disks, such IO are rejected by firmware as IO ERROR, however,
   on Samsung and PMCS devices, the firmware processes such IO and returns
   success silently, but internally the unaligned IOs may cause data issues.

   So far this is only seen when using the NVMe devices in multi-node vSAN
   environment, and it may cause severe data problems like data corruption,
   PSOD, or data loss.

   The fix is to advertise an alignment requirement to PSA to ask the stack
   to re-align IO if necessary.

   Tested with Samsung, Intel, and PMCS NVMe devices in a 3-node vSAN cluster,
   we can easily hit PSOD when creating a folder or upload a file in the
   vsanDatastore, we can no longer see PSOD issues after this change.

2014/09/10 1.0e.0.28-1vmw

   Fix PR 1315534: Mark controller offline when the controller is quiesced.

   This change fixes a bug in the management code path that would incorrectly
   report controllers as Online even when the controller is actually quiesced.

   This change also blocks admin commands if the controller is offline.

2014/08/10 1.0e.0.27-1vmw

   Fix PR 1299256: Replace ':' with ' ' in Model & Serial Number to avoid a
   conflict.

   According to SPC, any printable ASCII characters should be allowed in Model &
   Serial Number. However, if ':' is used, there is a conflict with partition
   showing under /dev/disks. This change replaces ':' in Model Number with ' '
   to avoid that conflict.

   This change also fixes a typo with the wrong args sequence in
   NvmeQueue_Construct.

2014/07/27 1.0e.0.26-1vmw

   Fix PR 1287630: nvmecli returns "status Failed to initialize NVMe".

   Currently, kernel mode is 64 bits while userworld is 32 bits. The structure
   is aligned to 8 bytes in kernel while 4 bytes in userworld. This will cause
   the size of structrue nvmeAdapterInfo is different, thus cause fail of API
   vmk_MgmtUserCallbackInvoke.

   This change uses vmk_uint64 to indicate status of adapter, rather than enum,
   to make sure the structrue size is same between kernel and userworld.

2014/07/15 1.0e.0.25-1vmw

   Fix PR 1281151 & bring a script to automate nvme.sc according to target
   version.

   This change avoids the small size, discontiguous and unaligned SG elements to
   driver, which would hit PSOD in driver. Instead, we set the sgElemSizeMult of
   DMA constraint to 512 to ensure the size of SG elements to driver is a
   multiple of 512bytes.

   To verify this change, we also implement a test module (extended_sg_test) to
   issue crafted SCSI commands at SCSI device layer for bug reproduce and driver
   testing. Currently only one function is implemented:

   SmallIo: Issue a 512-byte read to the first sector of a SCSI device, with SG
            elements coming from 3 pages, discontiguous and unaligned.
            Usage:
               vmkmgmt-keyval -i <instance> -k SmallIo -v <SCSI device name>

   In addtion, this change brings a bash script: build_fix.sh to automate the
   nvme.sc file depending on the target (ESXi 5.5 or ESXi 6.0) and ddk versions.
   We currently reserve the nvme.sc file for internal build system.

2014/07/13 1.0e.0.24-1vmw

   Fix PR 1272104: Expose the Status of namespace (online/offline) to end users.

   Currently we don't expose the status of namespace (online or offline) to end
   users. In our current implementation, we can only online/offline all
   namespaces of an adapter. In this change we add the status of adatper in
   structure nvmeAdapterInfo, shared between driver and userworld. The status of
   adapter could be shown by nvmecli.

2014/06/13 1.0e.0.23-1vmw

   Fix PR 1267986: Enhance namespace metadata check when starting controller.

   Currently our native nvme driver doesn't support LBA format with metadata.
   That means we should format the drive/namespace to LBA format with metadata
   size == 0. If the drive/namespace is formated with metadata, we will hit
   IOMMU PSOD in NvmeCtrlr_WaitDeviceReady function, which issues read command
   to firmware without check whether we support the namespace.

   This change adds metadata check in function NvmeCtrlr_WaitDeviceReady and
   offline the unsupported namespace.

2014/06/04 1.0e.0.22-1vmw

   Fix two DDV related PRs to enhance error handling.

   PR 1258674: Return error status when function vmk_DeviceRegister failed.
   PR 1258160: Add error handler when function vmk_LogicalCreateBusAddress
   failed.

2014/04/29 1.0e.0.21-1vmw

   Re-enable SCSI Device ID

   This change re-enables SCSI Device ID reporting via SCSI INQUIRY EVPD 80 and
   EVPD 83 page, using T10 Vendor ID format.

   In this change, we generate SCSI INQUIRY EVPD 83 ID using T10 Vendor ID
   format. The translation from NVMe to SCSI T10 Vendor ID is defined by "NVM
   Express SCSI Translation Reference 1_1 Gold" specification from NVMe WG, with
   the following modifications for VMware environment:

   1. If the device does report valid EUI64 field in IDENTIFY NAMESPACE
   response, the T10 VENDOR IDENTIFICATION field is then formed with 40-byte
   Model string (from IDENTIFY CONTROLLER response) plus 16-byte EUI64 string
   (hex representation of 64-bit EUI64);

   2. If the device does NOT report valid EUI64 field in IDENTIFY NAMESPACE
   response, then the T10 VENDOR IDENTIFICATION is generated by a concatenation
   of 40-byte Model string (from IDENTIFY CONTROLLER response), 20-byte Serial
   Number string (from IDENTIFY CONTROLLER response), and 8-byte namespace ID
   (hex representation of 32-bit namespace ID).

   We also implemented a hack for Samsung pre-production devices which have
   non-unique serial numbers.

2014/04/28 1.0e.0.20-1vmw

   Fix PR 1238010: BlueScreen: ASSERT bora/vmkernel/main/heap.c:4316

   If the controller is hot removed just after entering quiesce state, driver
   would do NvmeCtrlr_HwStop and do not return VMK_OK. This will cause the
   quiesce failed. After that PSA detects the device remove and will call
   quiesce again, thus double free the IO queue in NvmeCtrlr_HwStop and PSOD.

   This change makes NvmeCtrlr_HwStop return VMK_OK if the driver detects the
   controller is missing when driver is trying to stop it.

2014/04/25 1.0e.0.19-1vmw
   Fix PR 1239161: BlueScreen: #PF Exception 14 in world 1000014579:helper57-0
                   IP 0x418032aaa45b addr 0x3 PTEs:0x1327aa027;0x85d9ae027;0x0;

   NvmeCore_PutCmdInfo() should set member of "cleanup" to NULL.
   NvmeCore_PutCmdInfo() is used to put back current cmdInfo to qinfo->cmdFree.
   Hence it should reset member of "cleanup" to NULL. Otherwise, the nextnvme
   command may refer to the member incorrectly.

2014/04/21 1.0e.0.18-1vmw

   Fix PR 1233198: IOMMU Fault detected for 0000:8b:00.0 (vmhba2/nvme) IOaddr:
                   0x197adf000 Mask: 0x5 Domain: 0x430260f1c090

   If an Admin Passthru command failed due to some reasons (TIMEOUT, or Issuing
   world being killed), the DMA buffer associated with the command will be
   freed, however, if the command is still inside hardware after DMA buffer
   free, the hardware could continue executing the command and then accessing
   the already-freed DMA buffer, leading to IOMMU faults.

   The fix is to defer DMA buffer free till the actual command completion
   callback instead of SubmitCommandWait return, to make sure that as long as
   the command is outstanding in the hardware, the DMA buffer associated with
   this command is ready.

   Tested with nvmecli, by setting command timeout to a very small value.
   Observed that no IOMMU fault hit even if command times out and driver can be
   unloaded cleanly.

   Fix PR 1234212: nvmecli delete all the ns, the vmhba info dispears from
                   esxcfg-scsidevs -a

   If no namespaces are configured on the device, we could set
   scsiAdapter->maxLUNs to 0 which is not accepted by vmk_ScsiRegisterAdapter.

   The fix is to put a configurable "max_namespaces" variable as the maxLUNs
   parameter to make sure that the adapter registration is successful.

   Default max_namespaces is set to 1024.

2014/04/17 1.0e.0.17-1vmw

   Fix PR 1197329: BlueScreen: ASSERT bora/vmkernel/main/heap.c:4328

   - Enhance cleanup when device is hot removed.

     Currently in state transition of controller, we cann't do transition from
     FAIL state to MISSING state. When the controller is hot removed, it should
     be set MISSING state, but driver failed to set it to MISSING when its
     previous state is FAIL. As a result, driver do NvmeCtrlr_HwStop and don't
     return VMK_OK even if the controller has been removed. This will cause
     Driver_QuiesceDevice failed. PSA will try quiesce device again and invoke
     NvmeCtrlr_HwStop the second time, thus double free the IO queue, causing
     PSOD.

     This change enables the state transition from FAIL to MISSING.

   Fix PR 1119553: Samsung device returns "Namespace Not Ready" after hot insert

   Sumsung device takes some time to be ready after being inserted, this is the
   fw/hw limitation. If the driver didn't take this into consideration, IO
   commands issued immediately after insertion would fail with "INVALID NS OR
   FORMAT". This changeset is to fix this problem by probing the device after
   its insertion with a read nvme command composed by driver. NvmeCtrlr_Start()
   will not return successfully until the device is probed as ready. Of course,
   this probing will not last forever. 60 seconds is the upper line.
   NvmeCtrlr_Start() will fail if the device is not ready in 60 seconds.

   Per current testing, it generally takes 4 seconds to bring the device up.

   Fix PR 1224837: PSOD when unload the nvme driver while nvmecli is running

   - Skip task management abort if controller is not in OPERATIONAL state.

      When the controller is quiesced (in QUIESCED) state, if a task management
      abort comes in, it'll make the controller go to SUSPEND state then back to
      OPERATIONAL, which is not correct.

      This change blocks task management abort request if controller has already
      been quiesced.

   - Fix a potential command leak.

   - Fix a command timeout issue during driver unload

      Sometimes during driver unload, the driver quiesce could happen before PSA
      quiesce completes. In that case, the IO queues would have been destroyed
      while the SCSI HBAs and SCSI LUNs are still registered. When this happens,
      the stack could possibly issue down a SCSI command, but we fail to find a
      proper IO queue to handle this command eventually the command times out.
      During task management, since all the IO queues are destroyed during
      driver quiesce already, the driver can find no IO queues so the command
      will be lost forever in the driver.

      The fix is to reject a command to stack directly if no valid IO queues are
      found.

   - Add assertions before clearing nrAct and cmdActive during queue reset.

   - Fix PR 1224837: PSOD when unload the nvme driver while nvmecli is running
      There is no controller state check in the admin passthrough interface, so
      when the controller is doing reset or quiesce, the admin command interface
      could still be submitting new admin commands into the admin queue and mess
      up with the quiesce/tear down process.

      This particular PSOD indicates the qinfo->nrAct is positive, while
      qinfo->cmdActive is an empty list. This happens when we reset the admin
      queue with new admin command coming in. We reset qinfo->cmdActive in
      NvmeCore_ResetQueue(), but we does not reset nrAct to 0 and this is
      causing a mismatch between qinfo->nrAct and qinfo->cmdActive.

      There could be other problems when allowing admin commands to get through
      while we are doing NVM reset. This could possibly be the root cause of PR
      1219639 as well.

      The fix comes in two parts:

      1. Reject a command if queue has been suspended. This ensures that a
         command won't be put down to hardware when a queue has been suspended.
      2. Reject a command allocation if queue has been suspended. This ensures
         that no new active commands are allocated while we are
         resetting/quiescing a queue.

      This change also fixes a command leak problem when SubmitCommandAsync
      fails.

   Allocate more resources for heap and DMA buffers.

   This change bumps the limits of heap and memory pool to the following value:

   Heap initial from 2MB to 3MB;
   Heap max from 32MB to 3MB * MAX_ADAPTERS (64);
   MPOOL reservation from 1MB to 10MB;
   MPOOL limit from 20MB to 10MB * MAX_ADAPTERS (64);

                   kernel/nvme_core.c:1152 -- VMK_ASSERT(qinfo->nrAct == 0)

   Two race conditions identified during NVM Reset regarding this PR:

   1. In NvmeCore_FlushQueue, between NvmeCore_ProcessQueueCompletions() and
      iteration through qinfo->cmdActive, even if an admin command has been
      processed and completed in ProcessQueueCompletions(), it would still
      show up in qinfo->cmdActive because the actual completion (and command
      removal from qinfo->cmdActive) is done in another thread and is
      competing the lock that is protecting this list. So if the done()
      handler has been called in ProcessQueueCompletions(), it will be called
      a second time during the iteration of cmdActive list.

   2. Same function, between iteration of the cmdActive list and the assertion
      that checks the active commands to be "0", similar to 1, the actual
      completion and removal from cmdActive is done in another thread and by
      the time we reach the assertion, it would never be "0" since the other
      thread hasn't got its chance to remove the command from the list.

   A proposed fix (may not be very elegant) is to make sure that an active
   command (NvmeCmdInfo) is put back to the queue (PutCmdInfo() called) in the
   done() handler. That is, whoever is calling this, it should never reference
   the NvmeCmdInfo after a done() callback.

   Tested with 3 instances of nvme admin user space thread plus NVM Reset and
   module unload.

   The structure usr_io is used by userworld and vmkernel. In 32bits
   userworld, it aligned to 4 bytes, while in vmkernel, it aligned to 8 bytes.
   The difference will impact the size of the sturcture, which will make

2014/03/12 1.0e.0.13-1vmw

   Fix two issues in the NVMe driver

   1. Fix PR 1169232. According to the API doc of vmk_WorldWait(), spurious
      wakeups are possible when calling this API. So in rare circumstances, the
      driver could get a fake successful immediately after we call
      NvmeCore_SubmitCommandWait(), and the driver will complete an synchronous
      command twice, the first time in this fake completion, and the second time
      when the command is really completed by the hardware and is put to the
      completion queue. In that case, we hit assertion failure that indicates a
      double completion fault.
      The fix is to check for the command completion status (cmdInfo->status)
      after vmk_WorldWait() returns VMK_OK, and return to waiting when false
      wakeup is detected.
   2. Adjust timeout parameters of synchronous command. Make SubmitCommandWait()
      timeout to be based on number of microseconds (in consistency with the
      doc).

   7. Enhance queue suspend/resume/reset/flush operations

2014/01/07 1.0e.0.9-1vmw

   Remove underrun/overrun checking for dsm commands

   According to NVMe spec, DSM commands don't have bytesxferred informaiton
   returned when command is completed. Therefore we have no way to calculate the
   bytes being transferred in reality, so don't check overrun/underrun.

2013/12/17 1.0e.0.8-1vmw

   [PR#1120839] Add create namespace and delete namespace support

   They are IDT specific management operations, implemented as driver admin
   paththru commands.

   Two things to be mentioned with this feature:
   a. Namespace management (creation and deletion) should be done before you use
      the drive. We don't expect the user to do namespace management while the
      drive is busy serving IO request. So don't delete a namespace while the
      namespace is active.  This is what we expect before a namespace is
      deleted:
      - stop making any more IO request on a namespace
      - unmounts the namespace from the system such that nobody can access the
        namespace anymore
      - delete the namespace
   b. If all namespaces on a controller are deleted, next time ESXi is booted,
      the nvme card will not be successfully attached. But users may use this
      tool to create namespace and reboot the system to make everyting come
      back. Note that rebooting is still necessary now. More work needs to be
      done inside the driver to make it better handled.

2013/12/12 1.0e.0.7-1vmw

   Add support for SET/GET FEATURE and GET LOG management operations.

   This change implements feature set/get and log page get management
   openrations in the driver and esxcli.

   There are two features that set command may has no effect:
   - Interrupt Vector Config, it always returns "Coalescing Disable" and the
     "Interrupt Vector" is all zeros on Samsung devices, since Samsung device
     don't support interrupt coalescing.
   - Number of Queues, it always return 127 SQ and 127 CQ, no matter whatever
     the number to be set. It's set on the driver initialization stage and
     cann't be set use the command management operations.

2013/12/11 1.0e.0.6-1vmw

   Fix assertion failure in case of IO error

   PR 1146231: @BlueScreen: Failed at kernel/nvme_io.c:326

   The assertion at L326 for checking command completion status is not correct;
   the command completion status code could be some value other than SUCCESS
   if there are indeed I/O errors happened. Remove this assertion failure to
   get over the PSOD.

   PR 1119556: Device hang upon reaching max queue depth of one IO queue

   The driver handles QFULL condition in the following ways now:
   a. if the SCSI command is NOT splitted, and an designated IO queue is full,
      then we return VMK_SCSI_HOST_OK|VMK_SCSI_DEVICE_QUEUE_FULL to the upper
      layer;
   b. if the SCSI command has been splitted, and a portions of the SCSI command
      has already been submitted to hardware, then we raise an UNDERRUN
      condition and let upper layer retry the command.
      This prevents the SCSI command from hanging in the driver.

2013/12/09 1.0e.0.5-1vmw

   driver and cli.

2013/12/02 1.0e.0.4-1vmw

   Rework on the NVMe command submission and completionmechanism

   This is an aggregated change that reimplements the NVMe command submission
   and completion process for simpler code and better error handling. Details
   of changes include:

   1. Move command submission routine to nvme_core, and provide 3 major
      interfaces for command submission: async, wait, and poll;
   2. Make command completion done through callback, this simplifies the
      processing of the completion queue and make it better to handle the error
      codes;
   3. Implement the mapping between NVMe status code in the completion queue
      entry and Nvme_Status, and between Nvme_Status and SCSI completion status,
      for a centralized place to map SCSI error return codes;
   4. Cleaned up SCSI command handling code to cope with the new status mapping
      mechanism;
   5. Separate some of the OS functions (like logging, DMA memory management,
      etc.) into a separate oslib module.

   This is the initial cut of the architectural change to make the source code
   more clean with the following considerations:

   1. merge NVMe specific handlers into nvme_core;
   2. merge SCSI emulation layer to nvme_scsi;
   3. merge OS service routines into oslib;
   4. merge OS driver and IO stack interfaces to nvme_driver;
   5. merge management stuff to nvme_mgmt.

   Cautions:
   60 second wait on device start up is removed, so initial I/O to Samsung
   device after hot insert may fail.

2013/11/05 1.0e.0.3-1vmw

   Fix PR 1120921: Use global SMART info if per-NS data is not supported

   In current implementation, if the controller doesn't support SMART/HEALTH per
   namespace basis, empty information will be returned if the user's query
   identifies a namespace ID. This is not fully compliant with the NVMe spec.
   According to the spev, global SMART information should be returned in this
   case. The driver will further print a vmkernel log to identify this
   situation.

     hot insert

2013/09/25 1.0e.0.1-1vmw

   Fix an I/O error in release build

   This change fixes an I/O error in ESXi release build. The I/O submission
   and completion queue is created uninitialized, so there is a chance that
   ProcessCq could go across the last valid CqEntry because of the trash memory
   making phase bit to be 1. This does not happen on beta build because the
   memory has been pre-poisoned and trash memory contains valid phase bit.

   This change also adds a assertion failure at invalid command id to help
   debugging such problem.

2013/09/24 1.0e.0.0-1vmw

   Reset version string to 1.0e.0.0-1vmw.

   This change resets NVM Express driver's version string to 1.0e.0.0-1vmw.

   1.0e  : This defines the NVM Express Spec that the driver follows;
   0     : This defines the major version of the driver, starting from 0;
   0     : This defines the minor version of the driver, increases per change;
   1vmw  : This is the VMW revision number, for out-of-release fixes.

        adapters implemented.
      - Add a management stub for IOCTL command.
      - Implements basic admin command passthru support in the driver.

2013/09/11 1.3.6-1vmw

   Implement task management reset for NVM Express driver

   This change implements task management reset (lun reset, bus reset, target
   reset) in NVM Express driver. The driver does NVM reset upon receiving SCSI
   task management resets.

2013/09/09 1.3.5-1vmw

   This is to solve a memory access fault problem in SMART call back

   The admin command may timeout when there're stressful IOs running, which
   causes the callback to exit and release the memory reserved for GetLogPage
   before exiting. Since NVMe has no way to abort a command, the firmware may
   proceed the GetLogPage command later and try to write data to the memory
   space that has already been released. This causes an IOMMU fault. This
   change reserves a 512-byte space in the initialization of smart management
   handle, and holds it for log page info transfer during its lifetime. It also
   simulates a thread like behavior to directly return the cached data when a
   request is quite close to last one to avoid issuging unnecessary GetLogPage
   commands.

2013/08/28 1.3.4-1vmw

2013/07/08 1.2.0-1vmw

   Add DataSet Management Deallocation to NVMe driver

   DSM Deallocation is the NVMe implementation of TRIM, or SCSI UNMAP in the
   NVMe spec. With this change, the driver reports TRIM capability by returning
   required values in INQUIRY B0, READ CAPACITY 16, and MODE SENSE Control Page
   responses, accepts SCSI UNMAP commands, and translates SCSI UNMAP to DSM
   Deallocation NVM command to the device.

   This change also implements handlers for MODE SENSE Caching Page, MODE SENSE
   Power Condition Page according to NVM-Express-SCSI-Translation-Reference
   document.
